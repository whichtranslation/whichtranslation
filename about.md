Confronting the bewildering array of translations available for a given work can be daunting. _Which Translation?_ aims to make this process easier for prospective readers by listing available translations with excerpts for easy comparison.

The aim is not to select the objectively best translation for every work (if such a thing can exist), but to present translations with context and curation in order to enable readers to select the best translation for themselves and their purposes.

Currently, _Which Translation?_ is only focused on translations of works into English where multiple competing translations are available.
