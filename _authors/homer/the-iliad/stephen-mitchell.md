    excerpt: |+
      The rage of Achillesâ€”sing it now, goddess, sing <i>through</i> me
      the deadly rage that caused the Achaeans such grief
      and hurled down to Hades the souls of so many fighters,
      leaving their naked flesh to be eaten by dogs
      and carrion birds, as the will of Zeus was accomplished.
      Begin at the time when bitter words first divided
      that king of men, Agamemnon, and godlike Achilles.

      What god was it who caused the two men to clash?
