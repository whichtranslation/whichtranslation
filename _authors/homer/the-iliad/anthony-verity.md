      Sing, goddess, the anger of Achilles, Peleus' son,
      the accursed anger which brought the Achaeans countless
      agonies and hurled many mighty shades of heroes into Hades,
      causing them to become the prey of dogs and
      all kinds of birds; and the plan of Zeus was fulfilled.
      Sing from the time the two men were first divided in strifeâ€”
      Atreus' son, lord of men, and glorious Achilles.
      Which of the gods was it who set them to quarrel and fight?
