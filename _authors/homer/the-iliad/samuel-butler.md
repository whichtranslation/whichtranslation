      Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought
      countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send
      hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and
      vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on
      which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell
      out with one another.
      
      And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel?
