      Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
      Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
      That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign
      The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
      Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
      Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
      Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
      Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!
