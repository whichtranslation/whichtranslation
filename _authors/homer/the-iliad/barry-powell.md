      The rage sing, O goddess, of Achilles the son of Peleus,
      the destructive anger that brought ten-thousand pains to the
      Achaeans and sent many brave souls of fighting men to the house
      of Hades and made their bodies a feast for dogs
      and all kinds of birds. For such was the will of Zeus.

      Sing the story from the time when Agamemnon, the son
      of Atreus, and godlike Achilles first stood apart in contention.
      Which god was it who set them to quarrel?
