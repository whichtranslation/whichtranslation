    excerpt: |+
      Rageâ€”Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,
      murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,
      hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,
      great fighters' souls, but made their bodies carrion,
      feasts for the dogs and birds,
      and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end.
      Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed,
      Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles.
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What god drove them to fight with such a fury?
