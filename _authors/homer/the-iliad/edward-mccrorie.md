      Sing of rage, Goddess, that bane of Akhilleus,
      Peleus' son, which caused untold pain for Akhaians,
      sent down throngs of powerful spirits to Aides,
      war-chiefs rendered the prize of dogs and every
      sort of bird. So the plan of Zeus was accomplished
      right from the start when two men parted in angerâ€”
      Atreus' son, ruler of men, and godlike Akhilleus.

      Which of the Gods brought these two into conflict?
