      SING, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son Achilleus
      and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achaians,
      hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls
      of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting
      of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished
      since that time when first there stood in division of conflict
      Atreus' son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;What god was it then set them together in bitter collision?
