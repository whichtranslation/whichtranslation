      Achilles' baneful wrath resound, O Goddess, that impos'd
      Infinite sorrows on the Greeks, and many brave souls los'd.
      From breasts heroic; sent them far to that invisible cave
      That no light comforts; and their limbs to dogs and vultures gave;
      To all which Jove's will gave effect; from whom first strife begun
      Betwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis' godlike son.
      What god gave Eris their command, and op'd that fighting vein?
