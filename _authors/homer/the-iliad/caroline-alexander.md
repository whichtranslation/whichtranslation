    excerpt: |+
      Wrath—sing, goddess, of the ruinous wrath of Peleus' son Achilles,
      that inflicted woes without number upon the Achaeans,
      hurled forth to Hades many strong souls of warriors
      and rendered their bodies prey for the dogs,
      for all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished;
      sing from when they two first stood in conflict—
      Atreus' son, lord of men, and godlike Achilles.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the gods, then, set these two together in conflict, to fight?
