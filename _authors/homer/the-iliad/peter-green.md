      Wrath, goddess, sing of Achilles Pēleus' son's
      calamitous wrath, which hit the Achaians with countless ills—
      many the valiant souls it saw off down to Hādēs,
      souls of heroes, their selves left as carrion for dogs
      and all birds of prey, and the plan of Zeus was fulfilled—
      from the first moment those two men parted in fury,
      Atreus' son, king of men, and the godlike Achilles.

      Which of the gods was it brought them into contention?
