      RAGE:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing, Goddess, Achilles' rage,
      Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks
      Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls
      Of heroes into Hades' dark,
      And left their bodies to rot as feasts
      For dogs and birds, as Zeus' will was done.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Begin with the clash between Agamemnon—
      The Greek warlord—and godlike Achilles.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the immortals set these two
      At each other's throats?
