    excerpt: |+
      Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns
      driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
      the hallowed heights of Troy.
      Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,
      many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,
      fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.
      But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove—
      the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,
      the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
      and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.
      Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
      start from where you will—sing for our time too.
