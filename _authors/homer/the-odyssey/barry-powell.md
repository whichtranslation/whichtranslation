    excerpt: |+
      Sing to me of the resourceful man, O Muse, who wandered
      far after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy. He saw
      the cities of many men and learned their minds.
      He suffered many pains on the sea in his spirit, seeking
      to save his life and the homecoming of his companions.
      But even so he could not save his companions, though he wanted to,
      for they perished of their own follyâ€”the fools! They ate
      the cattle of Helios Hyperion, who took from them the day
      of their return. Of these matters, beginning where you want,
      O daughter of Zeus, tell to us.
