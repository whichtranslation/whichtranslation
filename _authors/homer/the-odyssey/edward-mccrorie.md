    excerpt: |+
      The man, my Muse, resourceful, driven a long way
      after he sacked the holy city of Trojans:
      tell me all the men’s cities he saw and the men’s minds,
      how often he suffered heartfelt pain on the broad sea,
      striving for life and a way back home for his war friends.
      Yet he saved no friends, much as he longed to:
      they lost their lives through their own reckless abandon,
      fools who ate the cattle of Helios the Sun-God.
      Huperion seized the day they might have arrived home.
       
      Tell us, Goddess, daughter of Zeus, start in your own place.
