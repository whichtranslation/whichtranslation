      Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story
      of that man skilled in all ways of contending,
      the wanderer, harried for years on end,
      after he plundered the stronghold
      on the proud height of Troy.
                                      He saw the townlands
      and learned the minds of many distant men,
      and weathered many bitter nights and days
      in his deep heart at sea, while he fought only
      to save his life, to bring his shipmates home.
      But not by will nor valor could he save them,
      for their own recklessness destroyed them all--
      children and fools, they killed and feasted on
      the cattle of Lord HÃªlios, the Sun,
      and he who moves all day through heaven
      took from their eyes the dawn of their return.
      Of these adventures, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
      tell us in our time, lift up great song again.
