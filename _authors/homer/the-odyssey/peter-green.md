    excerpt: |+
      The man, Muse—tell me about that resourceful man, who wandered
      far and wide, when he'd sacked Troy's sacred citadel:
      many men's townships he saw, and learned their ways of thinking,
      many the griefs he suffered at heart on the open sea,
      battling for his own life and his comrades' homecoming. Yet
      no way could he save his comrades, much though he longed to—
      it was through their own blind recklessness that they perished,
      the fools, for they slaughtered the cattle of Hēlios the sun god
      and ate them: for that he took from them their day of returning.
      Tell us this tale, goddess, child of Zeus; start anywhere in it!
