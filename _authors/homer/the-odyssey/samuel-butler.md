      Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who
      travelled far and wide after he had sacked the
      famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,
      and many were the nations with whose
      manners and customs he was acquainted;
      moreover he suffered much by sea while
      trying to save his own life and bring his
      men safely home; but do what he might
      he could not save his men, for they
      perished through their own sheer folly
      in eating the cattle of the Sun-god
      Hyperion; so the god prevented them
      from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about
      all these things, O daughter of Jove, from
      whatsoever source you may know them.
