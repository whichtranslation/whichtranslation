    excerpt: |+
      Tell me, Muse, of the man of many turns, who was driven
      far and wide after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy.
      Many were the men whose cities he saw, and learnt their minds,
      many the sufferings on the open sea he endured in his heart,
      struggling for his own life and his companions' homecoming.
      Even so he could not protect them, though he desired it,
      since they perished by reason of their own recklessness,
      the fools, because they ate the cattle of the Sun, Hyperion,
      and he took away the day of their homecoming. Tell us, too,
      goddess daughter of Zeus, starting from where you will.
