    excerpt: |+
      Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways,
      who was driven far journeys, after he had
      sacked Troy's sacred citadel. Many were
      they whose cities he saw, whose minds he
      learned of, many the pains he suffered in
      his spirit on the wide sea, struggling for
      his own life and the homecoming of his
      companions. Even so he could not save
      his companions, hard though he strove
      to; they were destroyed by their own
      wild recklessness, fools, who devoured
      the oxen of Helios, the Sun God, and
      he took away the day of their
      homecoming. From some point here,
      goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and
      begin our story.
