    excerpt: |+
      Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices,
      who wandered full many ways after he had
      sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many
      were the men whose cities he saw and
      whose mind he learned, aye, and many
      the woes he suffered in his heart upon
      the sea, seeking to win his own life and
      the return of his comrades. Yet even so
      he saved not his comrades, though he
      desired it sore, for through their own
      blind folly they perishedâ€”fools, who
      devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion;
      but he took from them the day of their
      returning. Of these things, goddess,
      daughter of Zeus, beginning where thou
      wilt, tell thou even unto us.
