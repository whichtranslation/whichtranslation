excerpts:
  - citation: "[_Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_](/borges/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius)"
    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The unnerving mirror hung at the end of a corridor in a villa on Calle Gaona, in Ramos Mejía; the misleading encylopedia goes by the name of _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917), and is a literal if inadequate reprint of the 1902 _Encyclopaedia Britannica_."
  - citation: "[_Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote_](/borges/pierre-menard-author-of-the-quixote)"
    excerpt: "He did not want to compose another _Don Quixote_ - which would be so easy - but _the Don Quixote_. It is unnecessary to add that his aim was never to produce a mechanical transcription of the original; he did not propose to copy it. His admirable ambition was to produce pages which would coincide - word for word and line for line - with those of Miguel de Cervantes."
  - citation: "[_The Lottery in Babylon_](/borges/the-lottery-in-babylon)"
    excerpt: "My father related that anciently - a matter of centuries; of years? - the lottery in Babylon was a game of plebeian character. He said (I do not know with what degree of truth) that barbers gave rectangular bits of bone or decorated parchment in exchange for copper coins. A drawing of the lottery was held in the middle of the day: the winners received, without futher corroboration from chance, silver-minted coins. The procedure, as you see, was elemental."
