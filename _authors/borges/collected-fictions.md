    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The mirror troubled the far end of a hallway in a large country house on Calle Gaona, in Ramos Mejía*; the encylopedia is misleadingly titled _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917), and is a literal (though also laggardly) reprint of the 1902 _Encyclopaedia Britannica_."
