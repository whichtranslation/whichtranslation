excerpts:
  - citation: "[_Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_](/borges/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius)"
    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The mirror troubled the far end of a hallway in a large country house on Calle Gaona, in Ramos Mejía*; the encylopedia is misleadingly titled _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917), and is a literal (though also laggardly) reprint of the 1902 _Encyclopaedia Britannica_."
  - citation: "[_Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote_](/borges/pierre-menard-author-of-the-quixote)"
    excerpt: "Pierre Menard did not want to compose _another_ Quixote, which surely is easy enough—he wanted to compose _the_ Quixote. Nor, surely, need one have to say that his goal was never a mechanical transcription of the original; he had no intention of _copying_ it. His admirable intention was to produce a number of pages which coincided—word for word and line for line—with those of Miguel de Cervantes."
  - citation: "[_The Lottery in Babylon_](/borges/the-lottery-in-babylon)"
    excerpt: "My father would tell how once, long ago—centuries? years?—the lottery in Babylon was a game played by commoners. He would tell (though whether this is true or not, I cannot say) how barbers would take a man's copper coins and give back rectangles made of bone or parchment and adorned with symbols. Then, in broad daylight, a drawing would be held; those smiled upon by fate would, with no further corroboration by chance, win coins minted of silver. The procedure, as you can see, was rudimentary."
  - citation: "[_The Garden of Forking Paths_](/borges/the-garden-of-forking-paths)"
    excerpt: "On page 242 of _The History of the World War_, Liddell Hart tells us that an Allied offensive against the Serre-Montauban line (to be mounted by thirteen British divisions backed by one thousand four hundred artillery pieces) had been planned for July 24, 1916, but had to be put off until the morning of the twenty-ninth. Torrential rains (notes Capt. Liddell Hart) were the cause of the delay—a delay that entailed no great consequences, as it turns out. The statement which follows—dictated, reread, and signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former professor of English in the _Hochschule_ at Tsingtao—throws an unexpected light on the case. The two first pages of the statement are missing."
