    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The mirror troubled the depths of a corridor in a country house on Gaona Street in Ramos Mejía; the encylopedia is fallaciously called _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917) and is a literal but delinquent reprint of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ of 1902."
