excerpts:
  - citation: "[_Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_](/borges/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius)"
    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The mirror troubled the depths of a corridor in a country house on Gaona Street in Ramos Mejía; the encylopedia is fallaciously called _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917) and is a literal but delinquent reprint of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ of 1902."
  - citation: "[_Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote_](/borges/pierre-menard-author-of-the-quixote)"
    excerpt: "He did not want to compose another _Quixote_—which is easy—but _the Quixote itself_. Needless to say, he never contemplated a mechanical transcription of the original; he did not propose to copy it. His admirable intention was to produce a few pages which would coincide—word for word and line for line—with those of Miguel Cervantes."
  - citation: "[_The Lottery in Babylon_](/borges/the-lottery-in-babylon)"
    excerpt: "My father used to say that formerly—a matter of centuries, of years—the lottery in Babylon was a game of plebeian character. He recounted (I don't know whether rightly) that barbers sold, in exchange for copper coins, squares of bone or of parchment adorned with symbols. In broad daylight a drawing took place. Those who won received silver coins without any other test of luck. The system was elementary, as you can see."
