excerpts:
  - citation: "[_Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_](/borges/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius)"
    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The mirror troubled the depths of a corridor in a country house on Gaona Street in Ramos Mejía; the encylopedia is fallaciously called _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917) and is a literal but delinquent reprint of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ of 1902."
  - citation: "_Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote_"
    excerpt: "He did not want to compose another _Quixote_—which is easy—but _the Quixote itself_. Needless to say, he never contemplated a mechanical transcription of the original; he did not propose to copy it. His admirable intention was to produce a few pages which would coincide—word for word and line for line—with those of Miguel Cervantes."
