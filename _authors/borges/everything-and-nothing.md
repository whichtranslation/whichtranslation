excerpts:
  - citation: "[_Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_](/borges/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius)"
    excerpt: "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encylopedia. The mirror troubled the depths of a corridor in a country house on Gaona Street in Ramos Mejía; the encylopedia is fallaciously called _The Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ (New York, 1917) and is a literal but delinquent reprint of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ of 1902."
  - citation: "[_Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote_](/borges/pierre-menard-author-of-the-quixote)"
    excerpt: "He did not want to compose another _Quixote_—which is easy—but _the Quixote itself_. Needless to say, he never contemplated a mechanical transcription of the original; he did not propose to copy it. His admirable intention was to produce a few pages which would coincide—word for word and line for line—with those of Miguel Cervantes."
  - citation: "[_The Lottery in Babylon_](/borges/the-lottery-in-babylon)"
    excerpt: "My father used to say that formerly—a matter of centuries, of years—the lottery in Babylon was a game of plebeian character. He recounted (I don't know whether rightly) that barbers sold, in exchange for copper coins, squares of bone or of parchment adorned with symbols. In broad daylight a drawing took place. Those who won received silver coins without any other test of luck. The system was elementary, as you can see."

    excerpt: |+
      On page 252 of Liddell Hart's _History of World War I_ you will read that an attack against the Serre-Montauban line by thirteen British divisions (supported by 1,400 artillery pieces), planned for 24 July 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. The torrential rains, Captain Liddell Hart comments, caused this delay, an insignificant one, to be sure.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following statement, dictated, reread and signed by Dr Yu Tsun, former professor of English at the _Hochschule_ at Tsingtao, throws an unsuspected light over the whole affair. The first two pages of the document are missing.
  - citation: "[_Death and the Compass_](/borges/death-and-the-compass)"
    excerpt: "Of the many problems which exercised the daring perspicacity of Lönnrot none was so strange - so harshly strange, we may say - as the staggered series of bloody acts which culminated at the villa of Triste-le-Roy, amid the boundless odour of the eucalypti. It is true that Erik Lönnrot did not succeed in preventing the last crime, but it is indisputable that he foresaw it. Nor did he, of course, guess the identity of Yarmolinsky's unfortunate assassin, but he did divine the secret morphology of the vicious series as well as the participation of Red Scharlach, whose alias is Scharlach the Dandy. This criminal (as so many others) had sworn on his honour to kill Lönnrot, but the latter had never allowed himself to be intimidated. Lönnrot thought of himself as a pure thinker, an Auguste Dupin, but there was something of the adventurer in him; and even of the gamester."
