The question "which translation should I read of Borges?" is a complicated one to answer, as Borges is primarily known for his short stories, which have been collected and translated in various forms over the years. Any given short story may appear in one collection or another, and many of these collections were translated by multiple translators working together.

Historically, Borges's fame in the English-speaking world started with the 1962 publication of two different and separately-translated short story collections, [_Ficciones_](ficciones) and [_Labyrinths_](labyrinths), which collected overlapping but different sets of stories. Of these, I judge [_Ficciones_](ficciones) to be the superior collection of translations (perhaps because I read it first). 

Most of the other writings of Borges have also received a recent translation by Andrew Hurley in the Viking/Penguin-published collections _Selected Non-Fictions_, _Selected Poems_, and [_Collected Fictions_](collected-fictions), subsets of which have been re-published in other collections, such as [_The Aleph and Other Stories_](the-aleph-and-other-stories),  _The Book of Sand and Shakespeare's Memory_, and _A Universal History of Iniquity_. Penguin has also published Hurley's translation of _The Book of Imaginary Beings_, which is not collected in any of the larger volumes of translations. A subset of the translations from [_Labyrinths_](labyrinths) have also been collected alongside a handful of essays in the New Directions-published [_Everything and Nothing_](everything-and-nothing).

[Norman Thomas di Giovanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Thomas_di_Giovanni) also produced a number of translations in collaboration with Borges himself, however, most of these are out-of-print.
