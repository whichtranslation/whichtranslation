The question "which translation should I read of Borges?" is a complicated one to answer, as Borges is primarily known for his short stories, which have been collected and translated in various forms over the years. Any given short story may appear in one collection or another, and many of these collections were translated by multiple translators working together.

Historically, Borges's fame in the English-speaking world started with the 1962 publication of two different and separately-translated short story collections, [_Ficciones_](ficciones) and [_Labyrinths_](labyrinths), which collected overlapping but different sets of stories. Of these, I judge [_Ficciones_](ficciones) to be the superior collection of translations (perhaps because I read it first). 

Most of the other writings of Borges have also received a recent translation by Andrew Hurley in the Viking/Penguin-published collections _Selected Non-Fictions_, _Selected Poems_, and _Collected Fictions_, subsets of which have been re-published in other collections, such as _The Aleph and Other Stories_.
